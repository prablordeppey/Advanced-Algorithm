# Advanced-Algorithm

This repository hosts all projects and reports for the Advanced Algorithms course in Universidade de Aveiro for the first semester of 2021/2022 academic year.

> MINIMUM CUT PROBLEM
 - Implements a Bruteforce/ExhaustiveSearch, Greedy-Heuristics and a Probabilistic Randomized with Improvements to solving this problem.
 - Computational complexities and running time of these algorithms were carefully analyzed.
 - Submitted on December 5th, 2021

> PROBABILITY COUNTERS
 - Some literary works of Shakespeare were considered.
 - Exact counts for each letter in chosen work.
 - Fixed Probability counter with probability 1/2 was implemented
 - Decreasing probability counter was also implemented as 1/sqrt(2)^k
 - Submitted on January 6th, 2022
